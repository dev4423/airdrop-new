Avoid clicking on links from unsolicited emails, messages, or unverified websites.\n    *   **Cross-Reference Information:** Compare details about the airdrop from multiple sources to confirm its authenticity. Look for consistent information across platforms.\n    *   **Be Wary of "Too Good to Be True" Offers:** Airdrops that promise excessively large rewards are often scams. Exercise skepticism and research the project thoroughly.\n*   **Protect Your Wallet:**\n    *   **Use a Dedicated Airdrop Wallet:** Create a new wallet specifically for airdrop participation. This isolates any potential risks and prevents you from exposing your main wallet to malicious activity.\n    *   **Never Share Private Keys or Seed Phrases:** Under no circumstances should you share your private keys or seed phrases with anyone. Legitimate airdrops will never ask for this information.\n    *   **Use a Hardware Wallet:** If participating in airdrops frequently, consider using a hardware wallet for added security. Hardware wallets provide an extra layer of protection by keeping your private keys offline.\n*   **Avoid Phishing Attempts:**\n    *   **Double-Check URLs:** Always double-check the website URL before interacting with it. Scammers often create fake websites that closely resemble legitimate ones to steal your credentials.\n    *   **Be Cautious of Social Media Links:** Be very wary of links posted on social media, especially on platforms like Twitter, Telegram, or Discord, as scammers often use these platforms to distribute malicious links.\n    *   **Do Not Input Your Private Key on Any Website:** No legitimate airdrop will ever require your private keys or seed phrases to claim rewards. If a website asks for this info, it\'s a scam.\n*   **Be Careful with Permissions:**\n    *   **Review Smart Contract Permissions:** When interacting with a smart contract for an airdrop, carefully review the permissions it requests before signing the transaction. Avoid giving contracts access to more funds than necessary.\n    *   **Limit Spending Approvals:** Understand the spending approvals you grant to smart contracts. If you\'re unsure, revoke approvals using blockchain explorers after the airdrop is complete.\n*   **Research the Project:**\n    *   **Understand the Project\'s Goal:** Research the project behind the airdrop to assess its legitimacy and potential risks. Look for whitepapers, team information, and community engagement.\n    *   **Check for Red Flags:** Be wary of projects with limited information, anonymous teams, or a lack of clear purpose. These are often signs of a scam.\n*   **Stay Updated:**\n    *   **Keep Up with Security Practices:** The cryptocurrency space is constantly evolving, so stay updated on the latest security practices and be aware of common scam tactics.\n    *   **Report Suspicious Activity:** If you encounter a suspicious airdrop or website, report it to the relevant authorities or platforms to help protect others.\n*   **Use Reputable Platforms:**\n    *   **Opt for Known Airdrop Aggregators:** While no platform is foolproof, try to use known, reputable airdrop platforms. These tend to curate airdrops, which can reduce the risk of exposure to scams.\n*   **Exercise Caution with Interactions:**\n    *   **Be wary of Personal Information Requests:** Avoid airdrops that demand unnecessary personal information like your ID, passport copies, and full address. Only provide details absolutely required to claim the airdrop.\n    * **Do not Engage in Unnecessary Social Media Actions:** Avoid airdrops that require you to follow or retweet multiple accounts that do not seem relevant or that are suspicious.\n*   **Document Everything:**\n    *   **Keep Records of Participation:** Track the airdrops you participate in, including the project details, wallet addresses, and transaction hashes. This can be helpful for reference.\n\nBy following these security tips, you can significantly reduce the risks associated with claiming cryptocurrency airdrops and protect yourself from scams and potential losses.\n\n', 'tool_call_id': 'call_sSexhmOnznWsaiyGswmoSc9y'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'tool_choice': 'auto', 'tools': [{'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'transfer_task_to_airdrop_discovery_agent', 'description': 'Use this function to transfer a task to airdrop_discovery_agent\nYou must provide a clear and concise description of the task the agent should achieve AND the expected output.\nArgs:\n    task_description (str): A clear and concise description of the task the agent should achieve.\n    expected_output (str): The expected output from the agent.\n    additional_information (Optional[str]): Additional information that will help the agent complete the task.\nReturns:\n    str: The result of the delegated task.\n', 'parameters': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'task_description': {'type': 'string'}, 'expected_output': {'type': 'string'}, 'additional_information': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['task_description', 'expected_output', 'additional_information']}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'transfer_task_to_legitimacy_assessment_agent', 'description': 'Use this function to transfer a task to legitimacy_assessment_agent\nYou must provide a clear and concise description of the task the agent should achieve AND the expected output.\nArgs:\n    task_description (str): A clear and concise description of the task the agent should achieve.\n    expected_output (str): The expected output from the agent.\n    additional_information (Optional[str]): Additional information that will help the agent complete the task.\nReturns:\n    str: The result of the delegated task.\n', 'parameters': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'task_description': {'type': 'string'}, 'expected_output': {'type': 'string'}, 'additional_information': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['task_description', 'expected_output', 'additional_information']}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'transfer_task_to_step-by-step_guidance_agent', 'description': 'Use this function to transfer a task to step-by-step_guidance_agent\nYou must provide a clear and concise description of the task the agent should achieve AND the expected output.\nArgs:\n    task_description (str): A clear and concise description of the task the agent should achieve.\n    expected_output (str): The expected output from the agent.\n    additional_information (Optional[str]): Additional information that will help the agent complete the task.\nReturns:\n    str: The result of the delegated task.\n', 'parameters': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'task_description': {'type': 'string'}, 'expected_output': {'type': 'string'}, 'additional_information': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['task_description', 'expected_output', 'additional_information']}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'transfer_task_to_security_and_compliance_agent', 'description': 'Use this function to transfer a task to security_and_compliance_agent\nYou must provide a clear and concise description of the task the agent should achieve AND the expected output.\nArgs:\n    task_description (str): A clear and concise description of the task the agent should achieve.\n    expected_output (str): The expected output from the agent.\n    additional_information (Optional[str]): Additional information that will help the agent complete the task.\nReturns:\n    str: The result of the delegated task.\n', 'parameters': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'task_description': {'type': 'string'}, 'expected_output': {'type': 'string'}, 'additional_information': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['task_description', 'expected_output', 'additional_information']}}}]}}

Avoid clicking on links from unsolicited emails, messages, or unverified websites.\n    *   **Cross-Reference Information:** Compare details about the airdrop from multiple sources to confirm its authenticity. Look for consistent information across platforms.\n    *   **Be Wary of "Too Good to Be True" Offers:** Airdrops that promise excessively large rewards are often scams. Exercise skepticism and research the project thoroughly.\n*   **Protect Your Wallet:**\n    *   **Use a Dedicated Airdrop Wallet:** Create a new wallet specifically for airdrop participation. This isolates any potential risks and prevents you from exposing your main wallet to malicious activity.\n    *   **Never Share Private Keys or Seed Phrases:** Under no circumstances should you share your private keys or seed phrases with anyone. Legitimate airdrops will never ask for this information.\n    *   **Use a Hardware Wallet:** If participating in airdrops frequently, consider using a hardware wallet for added security. Hardware wallets provide an extra layer of protection by keeping your private keys offline.\n*   **Avoid Phishing Attempts:**\n    *   **Double-Check URLs:** Always double-check the website URL before interacting with it. Scammers often create fake websites that closely resemble legitimate ones to steal your credentials.\n    *   **Be Cautious of Social Media Links:** Be very wary of links posted on social media, especially on platforms like Twitter, Telegram, or Discord, as scammers often use these platforms to distribute malicious links.\n    *   **Do Not Input Your Private Key on Any Website:** No legitimate airdrop will ever require your private keys or seed phrases to claim rewards. If a website asks for this info, it\'s a scam.\n*   **Be Careful with Permissions:**\n    *   **Review Smart Contract Permissions:** When interacting with a smart contract for an airdrop, carefully review the permissions it requests before signing the transaction. Avoid giving contracts access to more funds than necessary.\n    *   **Limit Spending Approvals:** Understand the spending approvals you grant to smart contracts. If you\'re unsure, revoke approvals using blockchain explorers after the airdrop is complete.\n*   **Research the Project:**\n    *   **Understand the Project\'s Goal:** Research the project behind the airdrop to assess its legitimacy and potential risks. Look for whitepapers, team information, and community engagement.\n    *   **Check for Red Flags:** Be wary of projects with limited information, anonymous teams, or a lack of clear purpose. These are often signs of a scam.\n*   **Stay Updated:**\n    *   **Keep Up with Security Practices:** The cryptocurrency space is constantly evolving, so stay updated on the latest security practices and be aware of common scam tactics.\n    *   **Report Suspicious Activity:** If you encounter a suspicious airdrop or website, report it to the relevant authorities or platforms to help protect others.\n*   **Use Reputable Platforms:**\n    *   **Opt for Known Airdrop Aggregators:** While no platform is foolproof, try to use known, reputable airdrop platforms. These tend to curate airdrops, which can reduce the risk of exposure to scams.\n*   **Exercise Caution with Interactions:**\n    *   **Be wary of Personal Information Requests:** Avoid airdrops that demand unnecessary personal information like your ID, passport copies, and full address. Only provide details absolutely required to claim the airdrop.\n    * **Do not Engage in Unnecessary Social Media Actions:** Avoid airdrops that require you to follow or retweet multiple accounts that do not seem relevant or that are suspicious.\n*   **Document Everything:**\n    *   **Keep Records of Participation:** Track the airdrops you participate in, including the project details, wallet addresses, and transaction hashes. This can be helpful for reference.\n\nBy following these security tips, you can significantly reduce the risks associated with claiming cryptocurrency airdrops and protect yourself from scams and potential losses.\n\n', 'tool_call_id': 'call_sSexhmOnznWsaiyGswmoSc9y'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'tool_calls': [{'id': 'call_CvOTrPz9jODpFACer6ORc6E9', 'function': {'arguments': '{"task_description":"Evaluate the legitimacy of the ongoing cryptocurrency airdrops found, which include Kamino Finance, various Solana Projects including Marginfi, Prospera, Magic Eden, and others listed on airdrops.io.

The airdrop of their KMNO token is confirmed with an official claim date of April 30, 2024. Information is widely available from reputable sources like Phantom and Cointab. The project appears to be legitimate.                                                                                                               | **Legitimate.**  This airdrop seems safe to participate in, provided you use official links and double-check the information.                                                                                              |\n| Marginfi          | 3          | Marginfi is another established DeFi protocol on Solana.  While the airdrop is real, there have been some recent community concerns about changes to their airdrop strategy and the use of a less than stellar partner. However, the airdrop is still expected to happen. Be cautious when interacting and make sure to double check URLs and connections to wallets.                                                                    | **Likely Legitimate, but with caution.** The project is real, but some users have expressed concerns, so proceed carefully.                                                                                                             |\n| Prospera         | 5          | Prospera is associated with ISC Money and is conducting an airdrop campaign. It appears to be a newer project and there is slightly less information readily available. There is a quest system associated with the airdrop which could be seen as slightly higher risk.                                                                                                         | **Potentially Legitimate, but requires caution.**  More research is needed and users should be aware of the higher risk due to the novel nature and quest based participation.                                                                                   |\n| Magic Eden      | 4          | Magic Eden is a popular NFT marketplace on Solana. While they did have a legitimate airdrop in the past, they are also often used in scams where fake airdrops are distributed.  It is important to be very careful and only use official links from Magic Eden and their official social media channels. Be wary of any airdrops that ask for "unpacking fees" or any connection that seems suspicious.                                            | **Potentially Legitimate, but high risk due to prevalence of scams.** Only engage with official announcements from Magic Eden and be extremely cautious about any unexpected airdrops that appear.                                                               |\n| airdrops.io     | 6          | Airdrops.io is a website that lists various airdrops. It is a portal or aggregator and not the issuer of any airdrops. While the website itself may be legitimate, the airdrops listed on it vary significantly in their legitimacy and risk. It is a good source for finding airdrops, but users must exercise caution and research the individual projects independently to ensure they are not scams.  Airdrops.io is more of an index and should not be considered a source for guaranteed safe airdrops. | **Neutral, but use with extreme caution.** Airdrops.io is a tool and not a validator.  Users should independently verify the legitimacy of each airdrop listed on the site.                                                          |\n\n**Key Considerations for Airdrop Safety:**\n\n*   **Verify Official Sources:** Always confirm airdrop details through official project websites and social media channels.\n*   **Beware of Phishing:** Be cautious of links from unofficial sources, especially on social media. Double-check the website URL.\n*   **Never Share Private Keys:** No legitimate airdrop will ever ask for your private keys or seed phrase.\n*   **Connect Wallets with Caution:** Be careful when connecting your wallet to any website. Use a separate wallet for airdrops to mitigate potential risks.\n*   **Too Good to Be True:** If an airdrop sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Research before you participate.\n* **Check Community Feedback:**  Look for discussions on social media, forums, and Reddit. Airdrops are often discussed and red flags are frequently raised by the community\n\n**Disclaimer:** Cryptocurrency airdrops carry risks. It is essential to do your own research (DYOR) before participating.

Avoid clicking on links from unsolicited emails, messages, or unverified websites.\n    *   **Cross-Reference Information:** Compare details about the airdrop from multiple sources to confirm its authenticity. Look for consistent information across platforms.\n    *   **Be Wary of "Too Good to Be True" Offers:** Airdrops that promise excessively large rewards are often scams. Exercise skepticism and research the project thoroughly.\n*   **Protect Your Wallet:**\n    *   **Use a Dedicated Airdrop Wallet:** Create a new wallet specifically for airdrop participation. This isolates any potential risks and prevents you from exposing your main wallet to malicious activity.\n    *   **Never Share Private Keys or Seed Phrases:** Under no circumstances should you share your private keys or seed phrases with anyone. Legitimate airdrops will never ask for this information.\n    *   **Use a Hardware Wallet:** If participating in airdrops frequently, consider using a hardware wallet for added security. Hardware wallets provide an extra layer of protection by keeping your private keys offline.\n*   **Avoid Phishing Attempts:**\n    *   **Double-Check URLs:** Always double-check the website URL before interacting with it. Scammers often create fake websites that closely resemble legitimate ones to steal your credentials.\n    *   **Be Cautious of Social Media Links:** Be very wary of links posted on social media, especially on platforms like Twitter, Telegram, or Discord, as scammers often use these platforms to distribute malicious links.\n    *   **Do Not Input Your Private Key on Any Website:** No legitimate airdrop will ever require your private keys or seed phrases to claim rewards. If a website asks for this info, it\'s a scam.\n*   **Be Careful with Permissions:**\n    *   **Review Smart Contract Permissions:** When interacting with a smart contract for an airdrop, carefully review the permissions it requests before signing the transaction. Avoid giving contracts access to more funds than necessary.\n    *   **Limit Spending Approvals:** Understand the spending approvals you grant to smart contracts. If you\'re unsure, revoke approvals using blockchain explorers after the airdrop is complete.\n*   **Research the Project:**\n    *   **Understand the Project\'s Goal:** Research the project behind the airdrop to assess its legitimacy and potential risks. Look for whitepapers, team information, and community engagement.\n    *   **Check for Red Flags:** Be wary of projects with limited information, anonymous teams, or a lack of clear purpose. These are often signs of a scam.\n*   **Stay Updated:**\n    *   **Keep Up with Security Practices:** The cryptocurrency space is constantly evolving, so stay updated on the latest security practices and be aware of common scam tactics.\n    *   **Report Suspicious Activity:** If you encounter a suspicious airdrop or website, report it to the relevant authorities or platforms to help protect others.\n*   **Use Reputable Platforms:**\n    *   **Opt for Known Airdrop Aggregators:** While no platform is foolproof, try to use known, reputable airdrop platforms. These tend to curate airdrops, which can reduce the risk of exposure to scams.\n*   **Exercise Caution with Interactions:**\n    *   **Be wary of Personal Information Requests:** Avoid airdrops that demand unnecessary personal information like your ID, passport copies, and full address. Only provide details absolutely required to claim the airdrop.\n    * **Do not Engage in Unnecessary Social Media Actions:** Avoid airdrops that require you to follow or retweet multiple accounts that do not seem relevant or that are suspicious.\n*   **Document Everything:**\n    *   **Keep Records of Participation:** Track the airdrops you participate in, including the project details, wallet addresses, and transaction hashes. This can be helpful for reference.\n\nBy following these security tips, you can significantly reduce the risks associated with claiming cryptocurrency airdrops and protect yourself from scams and potential losses.\n\n', 'tool_call_id': 'call_sSexhmOnznWsaiyGswmoSc9y'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'tool_calls': [{'id': 'call_CvOTrPz9jODpFACer6ORc6E9', 'function': {'arguments': '{"task_description":"Evaluate the legitimacy of the ongoing cryptocurrency airdrops found, which include Kamino Finance, various Solana Projects including Marginfi, Prospera, Magic Eden, and others listed on airdrops.io.

The airdrop of their KMNO token is confirmed with an official claim date of April 30, 2024. Information is widely available from reputable sources like Phantom and Cointab. The project appears to be legitimate.                                                                                                               | **Legitimate.**  This airdrop seems safe to participate in, provided you use official links and double-check the information.                                                                                              |\n| Marginfi          | 3          | Marginfi is another established DeFi protocol on Solana.  While the airdrop is real, there have been some recent community concerns about changes to their airdrop strategy and the use of a less than stellar partner. However, the airdrop is still expected to happen. Be cautious when interacting and make sure to double check URLs and connections to wallets.                                                                    | **Likely Legitimate, but with caution.** The project is real, but some users have expressed concerns, so proceed carefully.                                                                                                             |\n| Prospera         | 5          | Prospera is associated with ISC Money and is conducting an airdrop campaign. It appears to be a newer project and there is slightly less information readily available. There is a quest system associated with the airdrop which could be seen as slightly higher risk.                                                                                                         | **Potentially Legitimate, but requires caution.**  More research is needed and users should be aware of the higher risk due to the novel nature and quest based participation.                                                                                   |\n| Magic Eden      | 4          | Magic Eden is a popular NFT marketplace on Solana. While they did have a legitimate airdrop in the past, they are also often used in scams where fake airdrops are distributed.  It is important to be very careful and only use official links from Magic Eden and their official social media channels. Be wary of any airdrops that ask for "unpacking fees" or any connection that seems suspicious.                                            | **Potentially Legitimate, but high risk due to prevalence of scams.** Only engage with official announcements from Magic Eden and be extremely cautious about any unexpected airdrops that appear.                                                               |\n| airdrops.io     | 6          | Airdrops.io is a website that lists various airdrops. It is a portal or aggregator and not the issuer of any airdrops. While the website itself may be legitimate, the airdrops listed on it vary significantly in their legitimacy and risk. It is a good source for finding airdrops, but users must exercise caution and research the individual projects independently to ensure they are not scams.  Airdrops.io is more of an index and should not be considered a source for guaranteed safe airdrops. | **Neutral, but use with extreme caution.** Airdrops.io is a tool and not a validator.  Users should independently verify the legitimacy of each airdrop listed on the site.                                                          |\n\n**Key Considerations for Airdrop Safety:**\n\n*   **Verify Official Sources:** Always confirm airdrop details through official project websites and social media channels.\n*   **Beware of Phishing:** Be cautious of links from unofficial sources, especially on social media. Double-check the website URL.\n*   **Never Share Private Keys:** No legitimate airdrop will ever ask for your private keys or seed phrase.\n*   **Connect Wallets with Caution:** Be careful when connecting your wallet to any website. Use a separate wallet for airdrops to mitigate potential risks.\n*   **Too Good to Be True:** If an airdrop sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Research before you participate.\n* **Check Community Feedback:**  Look for discussions on social media, forums, and Reddit. Airdrops are often discussed and red flags are frequently raised by the community\n\n**Disclaimer:** Cryptocurrency airdrops carry risks.

Do not trust links from unknown sources or social media direct messages.\n*   **Beware of Phishing:** Scammers often create fake websites that look very similar to the real ones. Double-check the URL in your browser to ensure it\'s the correct website. Look for the lock icon in your browser\'s address bar, which indicates a secure (HTTPS) connection.\n*   **Use a Dedicated Wallet:** For airdrops, consider using a separate cryptocurrency wallet from your main one. This reduces the risk if a malicious website or contract is involved.\n*   **Don\'t Share Your Seed Phrase or Private Keys:** Never share your seed phrase or private keys with anyone, including "support" personnel.\n*   **Start Small:** If possible, interact with the claiming process with a minimal amount of funds to test the process.\n*   **Review Smart Contracts:** If you have the technical knowledge, review any smart contracts that you interact with. Be wary of any contract that requires you to authorize permissions beyond whats needed to claim the airdrop.\n*   **Be Patient:** Airdrops can be hyped events. If there are too many users trying to access a claim at once, there may be delays.\n*   **Stay Updated:**  Check official social media from each project for updates and delays.\n\n**Claiming Instructions**\n\nHere are step-by-step instructions for claiming airdrops. Keep in mind that exact steps may vary based on specific project requirements.\n\n### 1. **Wallet Setup and Preparation (Solana Blockchain)**\n\n*   **Choose a Solana Wallet:**\n    *   **Phantom:** A popular browser extension and mobile wallet for Solana. Highly recommended.\n    *   **Solflare:** Another reputable option for both browser and mobile.\n    *   **Other Options:** There are other Solana wallets, but make sure you are using one that is trusted and reputable.\n*   **Install and Secure Your Wallet:**\n    1.  Go to the official website for your selected wallet (e.g., phantom.app or solflare.com).\n    2.  Download and install the appropriate browser extension or mobile application.\n    3.  Create a new wallet. Be sure to keep your seed phrase in a safe place that is never accessible online.\n    4.  Set up a strong password.\n*   **Fund Your Wallet:**\n    *   You will likely need a small amount of SOL in your wallet to pay transaction fees.\n    *   Send SOL to your new wallet address from an exchange or another wallet that you own.\n*   **Connect Your Wallet to the Project Website:**\n    1.  Navigate to the official website for the specific project (Kamino Finance, Marginfi, or Magic Eden, following verified links)\n    2.  Look for a "Connect Wallet" or similar button.\n    3.  Select your wallet (Phantom, Solflare, etc.)\n    4.  Approve the connection request in your wallet.\n\n### 2. **Claiming Specific Airdrops**\n\nHere\'s a general process for each project; actual steps may vary. Remember to follow the project\'s official instructions.\n\n#### **A. Kamino Finance Airdrop**\n\n1.  **Navigate to the Airdrop Page:** Go to the official Kamino Finance website, and find the airdrop claim page from their official channels.\n2.  **Verify Eligibility:** The website should verify your eligibility based on your wallet address. This check may occur automatically.\n3.  **Claim:** If you\'re eligible, there should be a "Claim" button. Click it.\n4.  **Approve the Transaction:** Your wallet will prompt you to confirm a transaction. Carefully review the transaction details. This will likely involve a small SOL fee.\n5.  **Confirm Transaction:** Once you confirm the transaction, the airdrop tokens should be sent to your wallet. The tokens may not appear instantly.\n6.  **Check your Wallet:** After a short time, check the token balance in your wallet. If the token is new you may have to add it by using the contract address on a block explorer.\n\n#### **B. Marginfi Airdrop**\n\n1.  **Locate the Airdrop Page:** Go to the official Marginfi website and find the airdrop section via their official channels.\n2.  **Verify Eligibility:** The website will check your wallet\'s eligibility.\n3.  **Claim:** Find and click the "Claim" button.\n4.  **Approve Transaction:** Your wallet will request transaction confirmation. Pay close attention to the details.\n5.  **Wait for Confirmation:** Allow time for the transaction to be confirmed.\n6.  **Check Wallet Balance:** Look for the tokens in your wallet balance.\n\n#### **C. Magic Eden Airdrop**\n\n1.  **Access Magic Eden Platform:** Go to the official Magic Eden website and find the airdrop page through official channels.\n2.  **Verify Eligibility:** The website will automatically confirm your eligibility.\n3.  **Claim Airdrop:** If you are eligible, locate the "Claim" option on the page and click it.\n4.  **Confirm Transaction:** Your wallet will request authorization to complete the transaction with a small fee.\n5.  **Await Confirmation:** The transaction may take some time to be fully confirmed.\n6.  **Check Wallet:** View your wallet balance to ensure the airdropped tokens have been received.\n\n**Important Considerations for All Claims:**\n\n*   **Transaction Fees (Gas):**  On the Solana network, transaction fees are typically low (less than a penny). However, be aware that network congestion can sometimes lead to higher fees. Make sure you have a small amount of SOL to pay the fees.\n*   **Token Visibility:** Newly airdropped tokens might not automatically show up in your wallet. You may need to import the token\'s address manually into your wallet interface if the tokens don\'t appear.\n*   **Avoid Suspicious Activities:** If a website or claiming process asks for too much information, access to your wallet, or any suspicious permissions, stop the process immediately.\n*   **Stay Updated with Official Channels:** Keep an eye on the project\'s official Twitter (X), Discord, and Telegram channels for any updates, including delays, changes, or warnings.\n*   **Claiming Window:** Airdrops usually have a claim deadline. Do not miss it to ensure you get your tokens.\n*   **Be Realistic:** Not all airdrops have high value, sometimes they may have no value at all. Airdrops are usually for project promotion and are not guaranteed returns.\n\n**Final Note:**\n\nAlways prioritize your security. Follow these instructions and stay vigilant to avoid common airdrop scams. If you are uncertain about any aspect of the claiming process, it is safer to wait and ask for clarifications from official sources, rather than rushing into something risky.\n\n', 'tool_call_id': 'call_KKOtG9BgPqBdZXRFGYWg3NO7'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'tool_choice': 'auto', 'tools': [{'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'transfer_task_to_airdrop_discovery_agent', 'description': 'Use this function to transfer a task to airdrop_discovery_agent\nYou must provide a clear and concise description of the task the agent should achieve AND the expected output.\nArgs:\n    task_description (str): A clear and concise description of the task the agent should achieve.\n    expected_output (str): The expected output from the agent.\n    additional_information (Optional[str]): Additional information that will help the agent complete the task.\nReturns:\n    str: The result of the delegated task.\n', 'parameters': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'task_description': {'type': 'string'}, 'expected_output': {'type': 'string'}, 'additional_information': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['task_description', 'expected_output', 'additional_information']}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'transfer_task_to_legitimacy_assessment_agent', 'description': 'Use this function to transfer a task to legitimacy_assessment_agent\nYou must provide a clear and concise description of the task the agent should achieve AND the expected output.\nArgs:\n    task_description (str): A clear and concise description of the task the agent should achieve.\n    expected_output (str): The expected output from the agent.\n    additional_information (Optional[str]): Additional information that will help the agent complete the task.\nReturns:\n    str: The result of the delegated task.\n', 'parameters': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'task_description': {'type': 'string'}, 'expected_output': {'type': 'string'}, 'additional_information': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['task_description', 'expected_output', 'additional_information']}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'transfer_task_to_step-by-step_guidance_agent', 'description': 'Use this function to transfer a task to step-by-step_guidance_agent\nYou must provide a clear and concise description of the task the agent should achieve AND the expected output.\nArgs:\n    task_description (str): A clear and concise description of the task the agent should achieve.\n    expected_output (str): The expected output from the agent.\n    additional_information (Optional[str]): Additional information that will help the agent complete the task.\nReturns:\n    str: The result of the delegated task.\n', 'parameters': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'task_description': {'type': 'string'}, 'expected_output': {'type': 'string'}, 'additional_information': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['task_description', 'expected_output', 'additional_information']}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'transfer_task_to_security_and_compliance_agent', 'description': 'Use this function to transfer a task to security_and_compliance_agent\nYou must provide a clear and concise description of the task the agent should achieve AND the expected output.\nArgs:\n    task_description (str): A clear and concise description of the task the agent should achieve.\n    expected_output (str): The expected output from the agent.\n    additional_information (Optional[str]): Additional information that will help the agent complete the task.\nReturns:\n    str: The result of the delegated task.\n', 'parameters': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'task_description': {'type': 'string'}, 'expected_output': {'type': 'string'}, 'additional_information': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['task_description', 'expected_output', 'additional_information']}}}]}}

Avoid clicking on links from unsolicited emails, messages, or unverified websites.\n    *   **Cross-Reference Information:** Compare details about the airdrop from multiple sources to confirm its authenticity. Look for consistent information across platforms.\n    *   **Be Wary of "Too Good to Be True" Offers:** Airdrops that promise excessively large rewards are often scams. Exercise skepticism and research the project thoroughly.\n*   **Protect Your Wallet:**\n    *   **Use a Dedicated Airdrop Wallet:** Create a new wallet specifically for airdrop participation. This isolates any potential risks and prevents you from exposing your main wallet to malicious activity.\n    *   **Never Share Private Keys or Seed Phrases:** Under no circumstances should you share your private keys or seed phrases with anyone. Legitimate airdrops will never ask for this information.\n    *   **Use a Hardware Wallet:** If participating in airdrops frequently, consider using a hardware wallet for added security. Hardware wallets provide an extra layer of protection by keeping your private keys offline.\n*   **Avoid Phishing Attempts:**\n    *   **Double-Check URLs:** Always double-check the website URL before interacting with it. Scammers often create fake websites that closely resemble legitimate ones to steal your credentials.\n    *   **Be Cautious of Social Media Links:** Be very wary of links posted on social media, especially on platforms like Twitter, Telegram, or Discord, as scammers often use these platforms to distribute malicious links.\n    *   **Do Not Input Your Private Key on Any Website:** No legitimate airdrop will ever require your private keys or seed phrases to claim rewards. If a website asks for this info, it\'s a scam.\n*   **Be Careful with Permissions:**\n    *   **Review Smart Contract Permissions:** When interacting with a smart contract for an airdrop, carefully review the permissions it requests before signing the transaction. Avoid giving contracts access to more funds than necessary.\n    *   **Limit Spending Approvals:** Understand the spending approvals you grant to smart contracts. If you\'re unsure, revoke approvals using blockchain explorers after the airdrop is complete.\n*   **Research the Project:**\n    *   **Understand the Project\'s Goal:** Research the project behind the airdrop to assess its legitimacy and potential risks. Look for whitepapers, team information, and community engagement.\n    *   **Check for Red Flags:** Be wary of projects with limited information, anonymous teams, or a lack of clear purpose. These are often signs of a scam.\n*   **Stay Updated:**\n    *   **Keep Up with Security Practices:** The cryptocurrency space is constantly evolving, so stay updated on the latest security practices and be aware of common scam tactics.\n    *   **Report Suspicious Activity:** If you encounter a suspicious airdrop or website, report it to the relevant authorities or platforms to help protect others.\n*   **Use Reputable Platforms:**\n    *   **Opt for Known Airdrop Aggregators:** While no platform is foolproof, try to use known, reputable airdrop platforms. These tend to curate airdrops, which can reduce the risk of exposure to scams.\n*   **Exercise Caution with Interactions:**\n    *   **Be wary of Personal Information Requests:** Avoid airdrops that demand unnecessary personal information like your ID, passport copies, and full address.

The airdrop of their KMNO token is confirmed with an official claim date of April 30, 2024. Information is widely available from reputable sources like Phantom and Cointab. The project appears to be legitimate.                                                                                                               | **Legitimate.**  This airdrop seems safe to participate in, provided you use official links and double-check the information.                                                                                              |\n| Marginfi          | 3          | Marginfi is another established DeFi protocol on Solana.  While the airdrop is real, there have been some recent community concerns about changes to their airdrop strategy and the use of a less than stellar partner. However, the airdrop is still expected to happen. Be cautious when interacting and make sure to double check URLs and connections to wallets.                                                                    | **Likely Legitimate, but with caution.** The project is real, but some users have expressed concerns, so proceed carefully.                                                                                                             |\n| Prospera         | 5          | Prospera is associated with ISC Money and is conducting an airdrop campaign. It appears to be a newer project and there is slightly less information readily available. There is a quest system associated with the airdrop which could be seen as slightly higher risk.                                                                                                         | **Potentially Legitimate, but requires caution.**  More research is needed and users should be aware of the higher risk due to the novel nature and quest based participation.                                                                                   |\n| Magic Eden      | 4          | Magic Eden is a popular NFT marketplace on Solana. While they did have a legitimate airdrop in the past, they are also often used in scams where fake airdrops are distributed.  It is important to be very careful and only use official links from Magic Eden and their official social media channels. Be wary of any airdrops that ask for "unpacking fees" or any connection that seems suspicious.                                            | **Potentially Legitimate, but high risk due to prevalence of scams.** Only engage with official announcements from Magic Eden and be extremely cautious about any unexpected airdrops that appear.                                                               |\n| airdrops.io     | 6          | Airdrops.io is a website that lists various airdrops. It is a portal or aggregator and not the issuer of any airdrops. While the website itself may be legitimate, the airdrops listed on it vary significantly in their legitimacy and risk. It is a good source for finding airdrops, but users must exercise caution and research the individual projects independently to ensure they are not scams.  Airdrops.io is more of an index and should not be considered a source for guaranteed safe airdrops. | **Neutral, but use with extreme caution.** Airdrops.io is a tool and not a validator.  Users should independently verify the legitimacy of each airdrop listed on the site.                                                          |\n\n**Key Considerations for Airdrop Safety:**\n\n*   **Verify Official Sources:** Always confirm airdrop details through official project websites and social media channels.\n*   **Beware of Phishing:** Be cautious of links from unofficial sources, especially on social media. Double-check the website URL.\n*   **Never Share Private Keys:** No legitimate airdrop will ever ask for your private keys or seed phrase.\n*   **Connect Wallets with Caution:** Be careful when connecting your wallet to any website. Use a separate wallet for airdrops to mitigate potential risks.\n*   **Too Good to Be True:** If an airdrop sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Research before you participate.\n* **Check Community Feedback:**  Look for discussions on social media, forums, and Reddit. Airdrops are often discussed and red flags are frequently raised by the community\n\n**Disclaimer:** Cryptocurrency airdrops carry risks. It is essential to do your own research (DYOR) before participating.

Do not trust links from unknown sources or social media direct messages.\n*   **Beware of Phishing:** Scammers often create fake websites that look very similar to the real ones. Double-check the URL in your browser to ensure it\'s the correct website. Look for the lock icon in your browser\'s address bar, which indicates a secure (HTTPS) connection.\n*   **Use a Dedicated Wallet:** For airdrops, consider using a separate cryptocurrency wallet from your main one. This reduces the risk if a malicious website or contract is involved.\n*   **Don\'t Share Your Seed Phrase or Private Keys:** Never share your seed phrase or private keys with anyone, including "support" personnel.\n*   **Start Small:** If possible, interact with the claiming process with a minimal amount of funds to test the process.\n*   **Review Smart Contracts:** If you have the technical knowledge, review any smart contracts that you interact with. Be wary of any contract that requires you to authorize permissions beyond whats needed to claim the airdrop.\n*   **Be Patient:** Airdrops can be hyped events. If there are too many users trying to access a claim at once, there may be delays.\n*   **Stay Updated:**  Check official social media from each project for updates and delays.\n\n**Claiming Instructions**\n\nHere are step-by-step instructions for claiming airdrops. Keep in mind that exact steps may vary based on specific project requirements.\n\n### 1. **Wallet Setup and Preparation (Solana Blockchain)**\n\n*   **Choose a Solana Wallet:**\n    *   **Phantom:** A popular browser extension and mobile wallet for Solana. Highly recommended.\n    *   **Solflare:** Another reputable option for both browser and mobile.\n    *   **Other Options:** There are other Solana wallets, but make sure you are using one that is trusted and reputable.\n*   **Install and Secure Your Wallet:**\n    1.  Go to the official website for your selected wallet (e.g., phantom.app or solflare.com).\n    2.  Download and install the appropriate browser extension or mobile application.\n    3.  Create a new wallet. Be sure to keep your seed phrase in a safe place that is never accessible online.\n    4.  Set up a strong password.\n*   **Fund Your Wallet:**\n    *   You will likely need a small amount of SOL in your wallet to pay transaction fees.\n    *   Send SOL to your new wallet address from an exchange or another wallet that you own.\n*   **Connect Your Wallet to the Project Website:**\n    1.  Navigate to the official website for the specific project (Kamino Finance, Marginfi, or Magic Eden, following verified links)\n    2.  Look for a "Connect Wallet" or similar button.\n    3.  Select your wallet (Phantom, Solflare, etc.)\n    4.  Approve the connection request in your wallet.\n\n### 2. **Claiming Specific Airdrops**\n\nHere\'s a general process for each project; actual steps may vary. Remember to follow the project\'s official instructions.\n\n#### **A. Kamino Finance Airdrop**\n\n1.  **Navigate to the Airdrop Page:** Go to the official Kamino Finance website, and find the airdrop claim page from their official channels.\n2.  **Verify Eligibility:** The website should verify your eligibility based on your wallet address. This check may occur automatically.\n3.  **Claim:** If you\'re eligible, there should be a "Claim" button. Click it.\n4.  **Approve the Transaction:** Your wallet will prompt you to confirm a transaction. Carefully review the transaction details. This will likely involve a small SOL fee.\n5.  **Confirm Transaction:** Once you confirm the transaction, the airdrop tokens should be sent to your wallet. The tokens may not appear instantly.\n6.  **Check your Wallet:** After a short time, check the token balance in your wallet. If the token is new you may have to add it by using the contract address on a block explorer.\n\n#### **B. Marginfi Airdrop**\n\n1.  **Locate the Airdrop Page:** Go to the official Marginfi website and find the airdrop section via their official channels.\n2.  **Verify Eligibility:** The website will check your wallet\'s eligibility.\n3.  **Claim:** Find and click the "Claim" button.\n4.  **Approve Transaction:** Your wallet will request transaction confirmation. Pay close attention to the details.\n5.  **Wait for Confirmation:** Allow time for the transaction to be confirmed.\n6.  **Check Wallet Balance:** Look for the tokens in your wallet balance.\n\n#### **C. Magic Eden Airdrop**\n\n1.  **Access Magic Eden Platform:** Go to the official Magic Eden website and find the airdrop page through official channels.\n2.  **Verify Eligibility:** The website will automatically confirm your eligibility.\n3.  **Claim Airdrop:** If you are eligible, locate the "Claim" option on the page and click it.\n4.  **Confirm Transaction:** Your wallet will request authorization to complete the transaction with a small fee.\n5.  **Await Confirmation:** The transaction may take some time to be fully confirmed.\n6.  **Check Wallet:** View your wallet balance to ensure the airdropped tokens have been received.\n\n**Important Considerations for All Claims:**\n\n*   **Transaction Fees (Gas):**  On the Solana network, transaction fees are typically low (less than a penny). However, be aware that network congestion can sometimes lead to higher fees. Make sure you have a small amount of SOL to pay the fees.\n*   **Token Visibility:** Newly airdropped tokens might not automatically show up in your wallet. You may need to import the token\'s address manually into your wallet interface if the tokens don\'t appear.\n*   **Avoid Suspicious Activities:** If a website or claiming process asks for too much information, access to your wallet, or any suspicious permissions, stop the process immediately.\n*   **Stay Updated with Official Channels:** Keep an eye on the project\'s official Twitter (X), Discord, and Telegram channels for any updates, including delays, changes, or warnings.\n*   **Claiming Window:** Airdrops usually have a claim deadline. Do not miss it to ensure you get your tokens.\n*   **Be Realistic:** Not all airdrops have high value, sometimes they may have no value at all. Airdrops are usually for project promotion and are not guaranteed returns.\n\n**Final Note:**\n\nAlways prioritize your security. Follow these instructions and stay vigilant to avoid common airdrop scams. If you are uncertain about any aspect of the claiming process, it is safer to wait and ask for clarifications from official sources, rather than rushing into something risky.\n\n', name=None, tool_call_id='call_KKOtG9BgPqBdZXRFGYWg3NO7', tool_calls=None, audio=None, images=None, videos=None, tool_name='transfer_task_to_step-by-step_guidance_agent', tool_args={'task_description': 'Craft step-by-step claiming instructions for the legitimate and potentially legitimate airdrops, including Kamino Finance, Marginfi, and Magic Eden.', 'expected_output': 'Detailed instructions for safely claiming the mentioned airdrops using official channels.', 'additional_information': 'Ensure the instructions comply with best security practices and highlight any necessary precautions to avoid scams.'}, tool_call_error=False, stop_after_tool_call=False, metrics={'time': 17.174457599991}, references=None, created_at=1736872044), Message(role='assistant', content="Here's a comprehensive guide on the current ongoing airdrops, their legitimacy, and secure claiming instructions:\n\n### Ongoing Airdrops\n\n1. **Kamino Finance (Solana)**\n   - **Details**: Airdrop for KMNO tokens as part of their Season 3 activities.\n   - **Verdict**: Legitimate.

Avoid clicking on links from unsolicited emails, messages, or unverified websites.\\n    *   **Cross-Reference Information:** Compare details about the airdrop from multiple sources to confirm its authenticity. Look for consistent information across platforms.\\n    *   **Be Wary of "Too Good to Be True" Offers:** Airdrops that promise excessively large rewards are often scams. Exercise skepticism and research the project thoroughly.\\n*   **Protect Your Wallet:**\\n    *   **Use a Dedicated Airdrop Wallet:** Create a new wallet specifically for airdrop participation. This isolates any potential risks and prevents you from exposing your main wallet to malicious activity.\\n    *   **Never Share Private Keys or Seed Phrases:** Under no circumstances should you share your private keys or seed phrases with anyone. Legitimate airdrops will never ask for this information.\\n    *   **Use a Hardware Wallet:** If participating in airdrops frequently, consider using a hardware wallet for added security. Hardware wallets provide an extra layer of protection by keeping your private keys offline.\\n*   **Avoid Phishing Attempts:**\\n    *   **Double-Check URLs:** Always double-check the website URL before interacting with it. Scammers often create fake websites that closely resemble legitimate ones to steal your credentials.\\n    *   **Be Cautious of Social Media Links:** Be very wary of links posted on social media, especially on platforms like Twitter, Telegram, or Discord, as scammers often use these platforms to distribute malicious links.\\n    *   **Do Not Input Your Private Key on Any Website:** No legitimate airdrop will ever require your private keys or seed phrases to claim rewards. If a website asks for this info, it\\\'s a scam.\\n*   **Be Careful with Permissions:**\\n    *   **Review Smart Contract Permissions:** When interacting with a smart contract for an airdrop, carefully review the permissions it requests before signing the transaction. Avoid giving contracts access to more funds than necessary.\\n    *   **Limit Spending Approvals:** Understand the spending approvals you grant to smart contracts. If you\\\'re unsure, revoke approvals using blockchain explorers after the airdrop is complete.\\n*   **Research the Project:**\\n    *   **Understand the Project\\\'s Goal:** Research the project behind the airdrop to assess its legitimacy and potential risks. Look for whitepapers, team information, and community engagement.\\n    *   **Check for Red Flags:** Be wary of projects with limited information, anonymous teams, or a lack of clear purpose. These are often signs of a scam.\\n*   **Stay Updated:**\\n    *   **Keep Up with Security Practices:** The cryptocurrency space is constantly evolving, so stay updated on the latest security practices and be aware of common scam tactics.\\n    *   **Report Suspicious Activity:** If you encounter a suspicious airdrop or website, report it to the relevant authorities or platforms to help protect others.\\n*   **Use Reputable Platforms:**\\n    *   **Opt for Known Airdrop Aggregators:** While no platform is foolproof, try to use known, reputable airdrop platforms. These tend to curate airdrops, which can reduce the risk of exposure to scams.\\n*   **Exercise Caution with Interactions:**\\n    *   **Be wary of Personal Information Requests:** Avoid airdrops that demand unnecessary personal information like your ID, passport copies, and full address. Only provide details absolutely required to claim the airdrop.\\n    * **Do not Engage in Unnecessary Social Media Actions:** Avoid airdrops that require you to follow or retweet multiple accounts that do not seem relevant or that are suspicious.\\n*   **Document Everything:**\\n    *   **Keep Records of Participation:** Track the airdrops you participate in, including the project details, wallet addresses, and transaction hashes. This can be helpful for reference.\\n\\nBy following these security tips, you can significantly reduce the risks associated with claiming cryptocurrency airdrops and protect yourself from scams and potential losses.\\n\\n\', name=None, tool_call_id=\'call_sSexhmOnznWsaiyGswmoSc9y\', tool_calls=None, audio=None, images=None, videos=None, tool_name=\'transfer_task_to_security_and_compliance_agent\', tool_args={\'task_description\': \'Provide general security tips for claiming cryptocurrency airdrops.\', \'expected_output\': \'A list of security tips and measures to follow when claiming cryptocurrency airdrops.\', \'additional_information\': \'Focus on best practices to avoid scams and ensure safety when participating in airdrops.\'}, tool_call_error=False, stop_after_tool_call=False, metrics={\'time\': 11.222443500009831}, references=None, created_at=1736871984), Message(role=\'assistant\', content=None, name=None, tool_call_id=None, tool_calls=[{\'id\': \'call_CvOTrPz9jODpFACer6ORc6E9\', \'function\': {\'arguments\': \'{"task_description":"Evaluate the legitimacy of the ongoing cryptocurrency airdrops found, which include Kamino Finance, various Solana Projects including Marginfi, Prospera, Magic Eden, and others listed on airdrops.io.

The airdrop of their KMNO token is confirmed with an official claim date of April 30, 2024. Information is widely available from reputable sources like Phantom and Cointab. The project appears to be legitimate.                                                                                                               | **Legitimate.**  This airdrop seems safe to participate in, provided you use official links and double-check the information.                                                                                              |\\n| Marginfi          | 3          | Marginfi is another established DeFi protocol on Solana.  While the airdrop is real, there have been some recent community concerns about changes to their airdrop strategy and the use of a less than stellar partner. However, the airdrop is still expected to happen. Be cautious when interacting and make sure to double check URLs and connections to wallets.                                                                    | **Likely Legitimate, but with caution.** The project is real, but some users have expressed concerns, so proceed carefully.                                                                                                             |\\n| Prospera         | 5          | Prospera is associated with ISC Money and is conducting an airdrop campaign. It appears to be a newer project and there is slightly less information readily available. There is a quest system associated with the airdrop which could be seen as slightly higher risk.                                                                                                         | **Potentially Legitimate, but requires caution.**  More research is needed and users should be aware of the higher risk due to the novel nature and quest based participation.                                                                                   |\\n| Magic Eden      | 4          | Magic Eden is a popular NFT marketplace on Solana. While they did have a legitimate airdrop in the past, they are also often used in scams where fake airdrops are distributed.  It is important to be very careful and only use official links from Magic Eden and their official social media channels. Be wary of any airdrops that ask for "unpacking fees" or any connection that seems suspicious.                                            | **Potentially Legitimate, but high risk due to prevalence of scams.** Only engage with official announcements from Magic Eden and be extremely cautious about any unexpected airdrops that appear.                                                               |\\n| airdrops.io     | 6          | Airdrops.io is a website that lists various airdrops. It is a portal or aggregator and not the issuer of any airdrops. While the website itself may be legitimate, the airdrops listed on it vary significantly in their legitimacy and risk. It is a good source for finding airdrops, but users must exercise caution and research the individual projects independently to ensure they are not scams.  Airdrops.io is more of an index and should not be considered a source for guaranteed safe airdrops. | **Neutral, but use with extreme caution.** Airdrops.io is a tool and not a validator.  Users should independently verify the legitimacy of each airdrop listed on the site.                                                          |\\n\\n**Key Considerations for Airdrop Safety:**\\n\\n*   **Verify Official Sources:** Always confirm airdrop details through official project websites and social media channels.\\n*   **Beware of Phishing:** Be cautious of links from unofficial sources, especially on social media. Double-check the website URL.\\n*   **Never Share Private Keys:** No legitimate airdrop will ever ask for your private keys or seed phrase.\\n*   **Connect Wallets with Caution:** Be careful when connecting your wallet to any website. Use a separate wallet for airdrops to mitigate potential risks.\\n*   **Too Good to Be True:** If an airdrop sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Research before you participate.\\n* **Check Community Feedback:**  Look for discussions on social media, forums, and Reddit. Airdrops are often discussed and red flags are frequently raised by the community\\n\\n**Disclaimer:** Cryptocurrency airdrops carry risks.

Do not trust links from unknown sources or social media direct messages.\\n*   **Beware of Phishing:** Scammers often create fake websites that look very similar to the real ones. Double-check the URL in your browser to ensure it\\\'s the correct website. Look for the lock icon in your browser\\\'s address bar, which indicates a secure (HTTPS) connection.\\n*   **Use a Dedicated Wallet:** For airdrops, consider using a separate cryptocurrency wallet from your main one. This reduces the risk if a malicious website or contract is involved.\\n*   **Don\\\'t Share Your Seed Phrase or Private Keys:** Never share your seed phrase or private keys with anyone, including "support" personnel.\\n*   **Start Small:** If possible, interact with the claiming process with a minimal amount of funds to test the process.\\n*   **Review Smart Contracts:** If you have the technical knowledge, review any smart contracts that you interact with. Be wary of any contract that requires you to authorize permissions beyond whats needed to claim the airdrop.\\n*   **Be Patient:** Airdrops can be hyped events. If there are too many users trying to access a claim at once, there may be delays.\\n*   **Stay Updated:**  Check official social media from each project for updates and delays.\\n\\n**Claiming Instructions**\\n\\nHere are step-by-step instructions for claiming airdrops. Keep in mind that exact steps may vary based on specific project requirements.\\n\\n### 1. **Wallet Setup and Preparation (Solana Blockchain)**\\n\\n*   **Choose a Solana Wallet:**\\n    *   **Phantom:** A popular browser extension and mobile wallet for Solana. Highly recommended.\\n    *   **Solflare:** Another reputable option for both browser and mobile.\\n    *   **Other Options:** There are other Solana wallets, but make sure you are using one that is trusted and reputable.\\n*   **Install and Secure Your Wallet:**\\n    1.  Go to the official website for your selected wallet (e.g., phantom.app or solflare.com).\\n    2.  Download and install the appropriate browser extension or mobile application.\\n    3.  Create a new wallet. Be sure to keep your seed phrase in a safe place that is never accessible online.\\n    4.  Set up a strong password.\\n*   **Fund Your Wallet:**\\n    *   You will likely need a small amount of SOL in your wallet to pay transaction fees.\\n    *   Send SOL to your new wallet address from an exchange or another wallet that you own.\\n*   **Connect Your Wallet to the Project Website:**\\n    1.  Navigate to the official website for the specific project (Kamino Finance, Marginfi, or Magic Eden, following verified links)\\n    2.  Look for a "Connect Wallet" or similar button.\\n    3.  Select your wallet (Phantom, Solflare, etc.)\\n    4.  Approve the connection request in your wallet.\\n\\n### 2. **Claiming Specific Airdrops**\\n\\nHere\\\'s a general process for each project; actual steps may vary. Remember to follow the project\\\'s official instructions.\\n\\n#### **A. Kamino Finance Airdrop**\\n\\n1.  **Navigate to the Airdrop Page:** Go to the official Kamino Finance website, and find the airdrop claim page from their official channels.\\n2.  **Verify Eligibility:** The website should verify your eligibility based on your wallet address. This check may occur automatically.\\n3.  **Claim:** If you\\\'re eligible, there should be a "Claim" button. Click it.\\n4.  **Approve the Transaction:** Your wallet will prompt you to confirm a transaction. Carefully review the transaction details. This will likely involve a small SOL fee.\\n5.  **Confirm Transaction:** Once you confirm the transaction, the airdrop tokens should be sent to your wallet. The tokens may not appear instantly.\\n6.  **Check your Wallet:** After a short time, check the token balance in your wallet. If the token is new you may have to add it by using the contract address on a block explorer.\\n\\n#### **B. Marginfi Airdrop**\\n\\n1.  **Locate the Airdrop Page:** Go to the official Marginfi website and find the airdrop section via their official channels.\\n2.  **Verify Eligibility:** The website will check your wallet\\\'s eligibility.\\n3.  **Claim:** Find and click the "Claim" button.\\n4.  **Approve Transaction:** Your wallet will request transaction confirmation. Pay close attention to the details.\\n5.  **Wait for Confirmation:** Allow time for the transaction to be confirmed.\\n6.  **Check Wallet Balance:** Look for the tokens in your wallet balance.\\n\\n#### **C. Magic Eden Airdrop**\\n\\n1.  **Access Magic Eden Platform:** Go to the official Magic Eden website and find the airdrop page through official channels.\\n2.  **Verify Eligibility:** The website will automatically confirm your eligibility.\\n3.  **Claim Airdrop:** If you are eligible, locate the "Claim" option on the page and click it.\\n4.  **Confirm Transaction:** Your wallet will request authorization to complete the transaction with a small fee.\\n5.  **Await Confirmation:** The transaction may take some time to be fully confirmed.\\n6.  **Check Wallet:** View your wallet balance to ensure the airdropped tokens have been received.\\n\\n**Important Considerations for All Claims:**\\n\\n*   **Transaction Fees (Gas):**  On the Solana network, transaction fees are typically low (less than a penny). However, be aware that network congestion can sometimes lead to higher fees. Make sure you have a small amount of SOL to pay the fees.\\n*   **Token Visibility:** Newly airdropped tokens might not automatically show up in your wallet. You may need to import the token\\\'s address manually into your wallet interface if the tokens don\\\'t appear.\\n*   **Avoid Suspicious Activities:** If a website or claiming process asks for too much information, access to your wallet, or any suspicious permissions, stop the process immediately.\\n*   **Stay Updated with Official Channels:** Keep an eye on the project\\\'s official Twitter (X), Discord, and Telegram channels for any updates, including delays, changes, or warnings.\\n*   **Claiming Window:** Airdrops usually have a claim deadline. Do not miss it to ensure you get your tokens.\\n*   **Be Realistic:** Not all airdrops have high value, sometimes they may have no value at all. Airdrops are usually for project promotion and are not guaranteed returns.\\n\\n**Final Note:**\\n\\nAlways prioritize your security. Follow these instructions and stay vigilant to avoid common airdrop scams. If you are uncertain about any aspect of the claiming process, it is safer to wait and ask for clarifications from official sources, rather than rushing into something risky.\\n\\n\', name=None, tool_call_id=\'call_KKOtG9BgPqBdZXRFGYWg3NO7\', tool_calls=None, audio=None, images=None, videos=None, tool_name=\'transfer_task_to_step-by-step_guidance_agent\', tool_args={\'task_description\': \'Craft step-by-step claiming instructions for the legitimate and potentially legitimate airdrops, including Kamino Finance, Marginfi, and Magic Eden.\', \'expected_output\': \'Detailed instructions for safely claiming the mentioned airdrops using official channels.\', \'additional_information\': \'Ensure the instructions comply with best security practices and highlight any necessary precautions to avoid scams.\'}, tool_call_error=False, stop_after_tool_call=False, metrics={\'time\': 17.174457599991}, references=None, created_at=1736872044), Message(role=\'assistant\', content="Here\'s a comprehensive guide on the current ongoing airdrops, their legitimacy, and secure claiming instructions:\\n\\n### Ongoing Airdrops\\n\\n1. **Kamino Finance (Solana)**\\n   - **Details**: Airdrop for KMNO tokens as part of their Season 3 activities.\\n   - **Verdict**: Legitimate.
